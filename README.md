# Importing data into Power BI 
● As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from the Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential.

# Data Model
● Data modelling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
● Poor data modelling affects the overall performance of the report.
● Following Good practices of data modelling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices of Blogs.
● In this project, we have followed the Snowfall data modelling method.
